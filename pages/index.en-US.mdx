TonMask wallet is duplicate MetaMask for The Open Network. TON blockchain has different interfaces with rest of blockchains, which makes it impossible to adapt existing wallets to use it.

## Overview

<Examples />

In this example, the `useSWR` hook accepts a `key` string and a `fetcher` function. `key` is a unique identifier of the data (normally the API URL)
and will be passed to `fetcher`. `fetcher` can be any asynchronous function which returns the data, you can use the native fetch or tools like Axios.

The hook returns 2 values: `data` and `error`, based on the status of the request.

## Features
