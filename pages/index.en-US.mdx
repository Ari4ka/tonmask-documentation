OpenMask wallet is MetaMask analog for The Open Network.
TON blockchain has different interfaces from the rest of the blockchains, for this reason,
it makes it impossible to adapt existing wallets to use it. OpenMask web extension wallet has the same architecture
as a MetaMask but builds with a modern stack and a more functional style.
