# Introduction

Welcome to TonMaskâ€™s Developer Documentation. TonMask is the trailblazing tool enabling user interactions and experience on Web3.
It is currently available as a browser extension. The purpose of this documentation is to illustrate how to build a dapp with TonMask.

## Why TonMask

TonMask was created to meet the needs of secure and usable TON-based web sites. In particular, it handles account management and connecting the user to the blockchain.

## Account Management

TonMask allows users to manage accounts and their keys in a variety of ways, including hardware wallets, while isolating them from
the site context. This is a great security improvement over storing the user keys on a single central server, or even in local storage,
which can allow for [mass account thefts](https://www.ccn.com/cryptocurrency-exchange-etherdelta-hacked-in-dns-hijacking-scheme/).

This security feature also comes with developer convenience: For developers, you simply interact with the globally available TON API
that identifies the users of web3-compatible browsers (like TonMask users), and whenever you request a transaction signature
(like `ton_requestAccounts`, `ton_getBalance`, or others), TonMask will prompt the user in as comprehensible a way as possible.
This keeps users informed, and leaves attackers only the option of trying to phish individual users, rather than performing mass hacks
([although DNS hacks can still be used for phishing en masse](https://medium.com/metamask/new-phishing-strategy-becoming-common-1b1123837168)).

## Blockchain Connection

TonMask comes pre-loaded with fast connections to the TON mainnet and testnet blockchain via public [toncenter.com](https://toncenter.com/) api.
This allows you to get started without synchronizing a full node, while still providing the option to upgrade your security and use the blockchain
provider of your choice.
