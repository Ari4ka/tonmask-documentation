# TON Provider API

OpenMask injects a global API into websites visited by its users at `window.ton`. This API allows websites to request users' TON accounts,
read data from blockchains the user is connected to, and suggest that the user sign messages and transactions. The presence of the provider
object indicates an TON user.

```js

// get injected provider from window
if (window.ton) {
    onTonReady();
} else {
    window.addEventListener('tonready', () => onTonReady(), false);
}

function onTonReady() {
  const provider = window.ton;

  console.log('isOpenMask=', provider.isOpenMask);

  startApp(provider); // initialize your app
}
```

## Basic Usage

For any non-trivial TON web application — a.k.a. dapp, web3 site etc. — to work, you will have to:

- Detect the TON provider (`window.ton`)
- Detect which TON network the user is connected to
- Get the user's TON account(s)

The provider API is all you need to create a full-featured web3 application.

## Properties

### ton.isOpenMask

<Callout>This property is non-standard. Non-OpenMask providers may also set this property to `true`.</Callout>

`true` if the user has OpenMask installed.

## Methods

### ton.isConnected()

```js
ton.isConnected(): Promise<boolean>;
```

This method returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `true` if the provider is connected to the current chain, or throw `Error` otherwise.

If the provider is not connected, the page will have to be reloaded in order for connection to be re-established.

### ton.isLocked()

```js
ton.isLocked(): Promise<boolean>;
```

This method returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `boolean` indicating if OpenMask is unlocked by the user.
OpenMask must be unlocked in order to perform any operation involving user accounts. Note that this method
does not indicate if the user has exposed any accounts to the caller.

### ton.send(args)

```js
ton.send(method: string, params?: unknown[] | object): Promise<unknown>;
```

Use request to submit RPC requests to TON via OpenMask. It returns a Promise that resolves to the result of the RPC method call.

The params and return value will vary by RPC method. In practice, if a method has any params, they are almost always of type `Array<any>`.

If the request fails for any reason, the Promise will reject with an `Error`.

See the OpenMask [RPC API documentation](/docs/api-reference/rpc-api) for details.

## Events

The OpenMask provider implements the [Node.js EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) API. This sections details the events emitted
via that API. There are innumerable `EventEmitter` guides elsewhere, but you can listen for events like this:

```js
ton.on('accountsChanged', (accounts) => {
  // Handle the new accounts, or lack thereof.
  // "accounts" will always be an array, but it can be empty.
});

ton.on('chainChanged', (chainId) => {
  // Handle the new chain.
  // Correctly handling chain changes can be complicated.
  // We recommend reloading the page unless you have good reason not to.
  window.location.reload();
});
```

Also, don't forget to remove listeners once you are done listening to them (for example on component unmount in React):

```js
function handleAccountsChanged(accounts) {
  // ...
}

ton.on('accountsChanged', handleAccountsChanged);

// Later

ton.removeListener('accountsChanged', handleAccountsChanged);
```

The first argument of the `ton.removeListener` is the event name and the second argument is the reference to the same
function which has passed to ethereum.on for the event name mentioned in the first argument.

### accountsChanged

```js
ton.on('accountsChanged', handler: (accounts: Array<string>) => void);
```

The OpenMask provider emits this event whenever the return value of the `ton_requestAccounts` RPC method changes.
`ton_requestAccounts` returns an array that is either empty or contains a single account address. The returned address,
if any, is the address of the most recently used account that the caller is permitted to access. Callers are identified
by their URL origin, which means that all sites with the same origin share the same permissions.

This means that `accountsChanged` will be emitted whenever the user's exposed account address changes.

### chainChanged

```js
ton.on('chainChanged', handler: (chainId: string) => void);
```

The OpenMask provider emits this event when the currently connected network changes.

All RPC requests are submitted to the currently connected chain. Therefore, it's critical to
keep track of the current network by listening for this event.

## Errors

```js
interface ProviderRpcError extends Error {
  message: string;
  code: number;
}
```

The [`ton.send(args)` method](#tonsendargs) throws errors eagerly.

## Using the Provider

```js

const provider = window.ton;

const connect = async () => {
    try {
        const accounts = await provider.send('ton_requestAccounts');
        const account = accounts[0];
        setAddress(account);
    } catch (e) {
        console.error(e);
    }
}

document
    .getElementById('connectButton')
    .addEventListener('click', connect);

```
