Today we are reaching milestone: the Beta version of OpenMask!

## Whatâ€™s OpenMask

OpenMaks is a non-custodial crypto wallet and gateway to blockchain dApps.

OpenMaks is a web browser extension that allows you to manage your TON (The Open Network) private keys. By doing so, it serves as a wallet for TON coins and allows you to interact with dApps (decentralized applications). Unlike some wallets, OpenMaks keeps all information on your device: not your email address, not your password, and not your Secret Recovery Phrase or other private keys. You retain all power over your crypto-identity.

## Why extension wallet

Public blockchains like TON or Ethereum are the next evolution of Internet databases, and the OpenMask wallet is the next evolution of the browser.

Because of deep integration with the browser, extensions wallets provide owners with the best user experience without no deal with security.

## Initial feature set

The list of features with OpenMask provide in the first release to simplify user's way to use blockchain technology:

- A key vault for **multiple** wallets
- Switch TON mainnet/testnet in one click
- Sending zero-commission transactions (only network fee) from the application
  - Support **TON DNS**
- Inpage TON provider
  - Read addresses and balances, suggest transactions
  - Manage network
- DApps **whitelist** with **permissions**
- Fiat balance, activity list
- Wallets settings to manage version and bounceable address type

## Open Source

The project is open-source, you can always "view the source" of OpenMask the way you do any Chrome extension, or view the source code on [Github](https://github.com/OpenProduct/openmask-extension).

## The future goals

OpenMask team realizes how useful maybe feature to manage different assets such as altcoins (aka jettons) or NFT. The service will deliver this feature as soon as possible.
